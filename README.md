quick p5.js sketch testing the blendMode function and using CCapture to make a gif of the sketch ! 

in order to make a gif you need to set the 'recording' variable to true, and you can set the number of frame in the gif with the 'gifLength' variable  (in sketch.js)
in index.html you can change the framerate of the gif.
